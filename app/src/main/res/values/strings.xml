    <string name="textHelp">The game consists of filling the maximum number of tiles of your color (the black one), turning the opponent\'s tiles (the app), which will have the white ones.</string>
    <string name="textHelp1">On each turn, the player places a chip in an empty square, so that between this and another of the same color, one or more tiles of the opponent are surrounded. The chips between them are automatically converted to the color of the person who has thrown them.</string>
    <string name="textHelp2">The lines count horizontally, vertically and diagonally. The same tile can capture pieces in different lines, if you want to surround them with this same color.</string>
    <string name="textHelp3">If a player can not place a tile in a described way, he loses his turn. Follow the alternation until neither of you can place a chip or the whole board has been covered with chips.</string>
    <string name="textHelp4">The player who has managed to place more tiles of his color wins.</string>
